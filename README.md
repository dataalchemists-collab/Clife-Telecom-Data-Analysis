## Objectives 
The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize key business metrics, market 
dynamics, and revenue patterns for Clife Telecom. A core focus is to assess the impact of the 
5G technology rollout on business performance and customer behavior. This analysis, 
conducted using Power BI, aims to support data-driven decision-making and strategic planning 
within the telecom sector. 
Through this project, we aim to: 
• Uncover patterns in performance metrics pre- and post-5G implementation. 
• Strengthen understanding of telecom business KPIs. 
• Demonstrate effective data storytelling and interactive visualization using Power BI. 

Power BI Dashboard Overview 
Key interactive dashboards developed: 
• User Engagement 
• Revenue Analysis 
• Market Share 
• Revenue Distribution 
Key Insights 
Active Users and Retention: 
Active User Count: Dropped by 8.28%, signaling a need for improving customer onboarding 
and retention strategies. 

Subscriber Churn: Unsubscribed users rose significantly by 23.50% post-5G with hotspots 
in Owerri (+55%) and Uyo (+52%), indicating possible customer dissatisfaction or adaptation 
challenges. 

Revenue Insights: Average Revenue per User (ARPU) rose by 11.05%, demonstrating 
successful revenue maximization from fewer but higher-paying users. Total Revenue slightly 
decreased by 0.50%, balancing higher per-user revenue against fewer overall subscribers. 

City-Level Highlights: Abuja and Enugu showed promising revenue growth, while Lagos, 
Benin, Ibadan, and Calabar faced revenue declines. Positive-performing cities offer potential 
insights for addressing challenges in struggling regions. 

Market Share and Revenue Distribution 

Market Share Insights: 
The introduction of 5G had minimal effects on overall market share distributions among 
leading companies (FEC, ICE & Luter, CLIFE, Payfone, Others), with marginal shifts 
observed. FEC and ICE & Luter maintained strong market dominance. 

Revenue Distribution: 
Company Revenue: FEC remains the largest market player, contributing approximately 35% 
of total market value. 

Plan Revenue: Plan-based revenue analysis identifies specific plans significantly driving 
revenue, highlighting potential optimization areas for less profitable plans. 
Recommendations 
User Retention: Conduct targeted surveys to understand user concerns driving unsubscribes.  
Implement loyalty programs and educational campaigns to improve customer retention. 

Revenue Optimization: Leverage successful practices from high-performing cities (like 
Abuja) to uplift revenue in cities experiencing downturns. Promote high-performing revenue 
plans and reassess or reconfigure underperforming plans. 

Market Stability: Reinforce market leadership strategies for companies holding significant 
market shares. Explore competitive analysis to counteract small but impactful shifts in market 
share. 
Conclusion 
The 5G rollout produced a nuanced business impact: an increase in individual user revenue, 
yet challenges in user retention and overall market stability. Implement loyalty programs and 
educational campaigns to improve customer retention. Promote high-performing revenue plans 
and reassess or reconfigure underperforming plans. Reinforce market leadership strategies for 
companies holding significant market shares. Explore competitive analysis to counteract small 
but impactful shifts in market share. Leverage the positive ARPU trend by promoting add-ons 
to existing customers, especially in markets where ARPU gains exceed 20%
